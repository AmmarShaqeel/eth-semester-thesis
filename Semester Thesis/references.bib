abstract = {The formation of glomerular ultrafiltrate is dependent on the prevailing hemodynamic forces within the glomerular microcirculation and the intrinsic properties of the filtration barrier. However, direct assessment of the permeability barrier is difficult with most available techniques. We used confocal microscopy to image 1-micron thick optical cross-sections of isolated intact glomeruli and glomeruli denuded of cells and quantitated dextran (70,000 mol wt) diffusion from the capillary lumen. Dextran permeance was 11 times greater for the acellular filtration barrier than the intact peripheral capillary. Consideration of the basement membrane and cells as series resistors demonstrated that cells of the filtration barrier contribute 90% of the total resistance to macromolecular permeance. Using a different approach, dextran sieving coefficients for acellular glomeruli consolidated as a multilayer sheet in a filtration cell were similar to those for intact glomeruli in vivo at radii 30-36 A and approximately 50 times greater at a dextran radius of 60 A. The presence of cells significantly reduced hydraulic permeability determined on consolidated intact or acellular glomeruli in an ultrafiltration cell with 50 mmHg applied pressure. The glomerular basement membrane does restrict macromolecular permeability but cells are important determinants of the overall macromolecular and hydraulic permeability of the glomerulus. Images},

The potential applications range from fully conformable, stretchable, skin sensors for robotic devices, wearable electronic devices, to flesh-like biodevices. One of the challenges in the development of stretchable electronics is to retain full functionality under high external strains in stretching. In this paper, we review a few approaches recently developed for stretchable electronics and highlight recent research efforts on multi-directional writing for stretchable, three-dimensional structures.}

	abstract = {Skin-like sensitivity, or the capability to recognize tactile information, will be an essential feature of future generations of robots, enabling them to operate in unstructured environments. Recently developed large-area pressure sensors made with organic transistors have been proposed for electronic artificial skin (E-skin) applications. These sensors are bendable down to a 2-mm radius, a size that is sufficiently small for the fabrication of human-sized robot fingers. Natural human skin, however, is far more complex than the transistor-based imitations demonstrated so far. It performs other functions, including thermal sensing. Furthermore, without conformability, the application of E-skin on three-dimensional surfaces is impossible. In this work, we have successfully developed conformable, flexible, large-area networks of thermal and pressure sensors based on an organic semiconductor. A plastic film with organic transistor-based electronic circuits is processed to form a net-shaped structure, which allows the E-skin films to be extended by 25\%. The net-shaped pressure sensor matrix was attached to the surface of an egg, and pressure images were successfully obtained in this configuration. Then, a similar network of thermal sensors was developed with organic semiconductors. Next, the possible implementation of both pressure and thermal sensors on the surfaces is presented, and, by means of laminated sensor networks, the distributions of pressure and temperature are simultaneously obtained.},

abstract = "Stable concentrated aqueous dispersions of silver nanoparticles of narrow size distribution were prepared by reducing silver nitrate solutions with ascorbic acid in the presence of Daxad 19 (sodium salt of a high-molecular-weight naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate) as stabilizing agent. The latter has excellent ability to prevent the aggregation of nanosize silver at high ionic strength and high concentration of metal (up to 0.3 moldm−3). The presence of the dispersing agent on the surface of silver particles was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and electrokinetic measurements, explaining both the negative charge over the entire pH range and the electrosteric effect responsible for their long-term stability. The other experimental conditions, i.e., the pH of the reacting solutions, the concentration of the stabilizing agent, and the metal/dispersant ratio, also have a significant impact on the size and stability of these dispersions. The final nanosize silver can be obtained as dried powder, and can be fully redispersed in deionized water by sonication."

The main objective here is to elucidate the role of alkaline ion in the synthesis of nanosized silver colloids using either formaldehyde or dextrose as the reducing agent. On the reaction mechanism, it was proposed that alkaline ion reacted initially (the first stage) with silver ion to form Ag2O, which was instantly converted to silver and the solution became acidic as a result. During the second stage, silver ion decreased gradually and continuously. Its rate of decrease was shown to follow the [Ag+]2/3 kinetics with an apparent activation energy of about 15.0kcalmol−1 for both dextrose and formaldehyde systems. Moreover, it was also found that the values of rate constant from silver kinetics were proportional to the quantity of NaOH added at the beginning of these reactions."

Quantitative analyses indicated that reduction of the silver precursor was promoted at elevated pH attributed to increased activity of ascorbic acid. As a result, number of the nucleus and thus the size of the silver nanoparticles were tunable by simply changing pH of the reaction system. Moreover, the shape of the nanoparticles became more spherical-like after being heate100°C for 2h to facilitate the intraparticle ripening."

abstract = "Silver nanoparticles were prepared in aqueous silver nitrate solution using hydrazine as reducing agents in presence of two ionic surfactants (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide; CTAB and sodium dodecyl sulfate; SDS) and one non-ionic surfactant (Triton X-100). The reaction rate was determined spectrophotometrically. The nature of the head group of these surfactants is responsible for the formation of stable, yellow and transparent silver sol. For a certain reaction time, i.e., 20min, the absorbance of reaction mixture first increased until it reached a maximum, then decreased with [hydrazine]. The reaction follows first-order kinetics with respect to each in [hydrazine] and [Ag+]. The results suggest formation of a complex between silver(I) and hydrazine, decomposes in a rate-determining step, leading in the formation of a free radical, which again reacts with the silver(I) in a subsequent fast step to yield the products. The transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images show that CTAB stabilized silver nanoparticles are spherical and of uniform particle size, and the average particle size is about 15nm."
